If the error persists, it may stem from deeper misconfigurations in your deployment settings or Docker setup. Here's a refined approach to address the issue step-by-step:

    1. Check Render’s Docker Compatibility
    Render supports Docker via Dockerfile, but does not directly support docker-compose.yml. To fix this:
    
    Replace docker-compose.yml with a Dockerfile:
    Here’s an updated and streamlined example to handle both backend and frontend in a single container:
    
    Dockerfile
    Copy code
    # Step 1: Build frontend
    FROM node:16 AS frontend
    WORKDIR /app/frontend
    COPY frontend/package*.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY frontend/ .
    RUN npm run build
    
    # Step 2: Build backend
    FROM node:16 AS backend
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY backend/package*.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY backend/ .
    COPY --from=frontend /app/frontend/build ./build
    
    # Expose port
    EXPOSE 5001
    
    # Start the backend server
    CMD ["node", "index.js"]
